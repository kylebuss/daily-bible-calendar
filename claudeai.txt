I've created a comprehensive Python program that will parse an Excel file and create Google Calendar events with StepBible.org links. Here's what the program does:
Key Features:

Excel Parsing: Reads an Excel file with columns for Date, Book, Chapter, and optional Title
StepBible Links: Automatically generates proper StepBible.org URLs for each Bible chapter
Google Calendar Integration: Creates calendar events using the Google Calendar API
Error Handling: Includes validation and error handling for common issues

Setup Requirements:

Install required packages:
bashpip install pandas openpyxl google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client

Google Calendar API Setup:

Go to Google Cloud Console
Create a new project or select existing one
Enable the Google Calendar API
Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client ID) for a desktop application
Download the credentials file as credentials.json and place it in your project folder


Excel File Format:
Your Excel file should have these columns:

Date: The date for the reading (e.g., "2024-01-01")
Book: Bible book name (e.g., "Genesis", "1 Samuel")
Chapter: Chapter number (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
Title: Optional description (e.g., "Creation Story")



Usage:

Update the excel_file_path variable with your Excel file location
Run the program: python bible_calendar.py
On first run, it will open a browser for Google authentication
The program will create calendar events with StepBible.org links

Sample Excel Structure:
The program includes a create_sample_excel() function that generates an example file to show the expected format.
StepBible Links:
The program automatically formats book names and creates proper StepBible.org URLs. For example:

Genesis 1 → https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=ESV|reference=Genesis.1
1 Samuel 5 → https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=ESV|reference=1Sam.5

Would you like me to modify anything about the program or help you set up the Google Calendar API credentials?
